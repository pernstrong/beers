# Beers?

## Abstract
Beers is a Turing Front-end Engineering project that allows a user to search for breweries by zip code or city. The user not only gets the information of the brewery but is also able to add notes about beers, select brewery features and add their own rativng. The user is also able to save breweries to their favorites. All the user entered stats will persist on page reload.

Beers is a React application written in TypeScript. It also utilizes React Hooks, React Router, and local storage. The data is fetched from the Open Brewery DB API. The testing suite includes unit, integration and asynchronous testing with the Jest and React Testing Libraries.
